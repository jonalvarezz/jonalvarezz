# My Personal Web Page

This is an application for building my personal website at [jonalvarezz.com](http://jonalvarezz.com)

The application is being builded in a MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node) with the purpose to manage a backend UI to create and modify my personal information and portafolio items and then show them in a nice landing page.

Some other tools used for the construction of this app are gulp, bower, stylus and kuoto swiss.

Feel free to use this repo as a guide for your learnings

## Roadmap
* **v0.4.0** The first release will use Express to send a plain html file. The information will be hardcoded in that file.
